Dr James Finnis is a lecturer in Computer Science at Aberystwyth University.
His research interests include artificial
neuroendocrine and neuromodulatory systems, modulatory neural network
architectures, intelligent robotics (particularly autonomous off-road
driving), and multispectral image processing.

He is also working as part of the [Aberystwyth ExoMars](https://exomars.wales/) team,
writing [software]({{<relref "../../research/pcot/landing/">}}) to help scientists and engineers
analyse data from the *Rosalind Franklin* rover.

He spent over 20 years working in the games industry before
moving into academia.
