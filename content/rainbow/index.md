# Rainbow Code

This is a very simple project codename generator, inspired by the 
random Rainbow Codes used by the British Ministry of Supply in World War II
(and by Charles Stross' "Laundry Files" novels). Each code is a random
combination of a colour and a noun.

There is a new code every hour. After 28 years they will start to
repeat.
