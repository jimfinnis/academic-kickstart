Games stream of CS12020.

## AberLED library

* The library for controlling the LED matrix shield can be downloaded
from [this link](/downloads/AberLED.zip), or (probably better) from
the CS12020 area on Blackboard.

* Automatically generated documentation is available
[from here](/docs/AberLEDdocs/).

### Downloading and installing a new version of the library

The latest version is **2.6**, dated **7th December 2015**.
You can check which version you have by looking near the top of AberLED.h.
To install the latest
version:
* Find your libraries directory - it should be something like Documents/Arduino/libraries in your home directory.
* Delete the existing AberLED directory.
* Download and reinstall the AberLED library as described in the first worksheet,
using either the link above or from Blackboard.
* Check that your programs still compile and run.

If you have any problems with this, please email me as soon as possible.

describing almost
the entire Arduino C language on 4 sides of A4. It might make a useful
reference or revision aid.
