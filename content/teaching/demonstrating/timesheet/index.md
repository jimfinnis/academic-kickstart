A timesheet template can be downloaded as an Excel file
[from this link](/downloads/DemonstratorTimesheet.xlsx).


When completing your timesheet please ensure:

* To only claim for work that has **actually been completed**
(you may work up to 15 hours per week) across all AberWorks roles.
* Please insert the start and finish time in 24 hour clock format,
including the minutes e.g. start time 14:00 finish time 17:30
* To submit your hours every month **(by the deadline - the 2nd of every month)**
even if you have only worked a few hours that month.  
* **Any timesheets received after the deadline will not be processed until
the following month**
* If hours worked fall within the following month payment will be made
in the following salary run i.e where the last days of one month fall
into the week ending of the next month for example 31st October 2023 will
fall into week ending 6th November 2023 therefore any hours claimed for
the 31st will be entered as a November claim and paid at the end of December.
* You should avoid accumulating hours as this will have implications on the
amount of tax and National Insurance that you pay.
* Ensure that you have fully completed the timesheet with all required
information, obtain supervisor sign off and forward to Glenwen for processing
on [gsm@aber.ac.uk](mailto:gsm@aber.ac.uk) no later than 2nd of the month. 
* Payment will be processed so that you will be paid on the last working day
of the month following the month you are submitting for.

If you have any questions about timesheets, contact Glenwen
on [gsm@aber.ac.uk](mailto:gsm@aber.ac.uk).
