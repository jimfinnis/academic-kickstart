A timesheet template can be downloaded as an Word document
[from this link](/downloads/DemonstratorTimesheetTemplate2023.docx).


When completing your timesheet:

* Insert the start and finish time in 24 hour clock format,
including the minutes e.g. start time 14:00 finish time 17:30
* Only claim for work that has actually been completed
(you may work up to 15 hours per week) across all AberWorks roles.
* Students working on a Student Visa will only be able to work hours that remain compliant with their Visa.
* Submit your hours every month (by the required deadlines as noted below)
even if you have only worked a few hours that month. The deadlines for 2024
will be added once they have been received from Payroll.

|Month claimed|Submission deadline|
|-------|-------|
|October|6th November 2023|
|November|4th December 2023|
|December|4th January 2023|

</div>

* **Any timesheets received after the deadline will not be processed until
the following month**
* Avoid accumulating hours as this will have implications on the
amount of tax and National Insurance that you pay.
* Forward your completed timesheet **via email only** to 
[gsm@aber.ac.uk](mailto:gsm@aber.ac.uk) by the deadline above, **with a copy
to the supervisor** of the module you are demonstrating for.
* Payment will be processed so that you will be paid on the last working day
of the month following the month you are submitting for.

If you have any questions about timesheets, contact Glenwen
on [gsm@aber.ac.uk](mailto:gsm@aber.ac.uk).
