landing/    : top level page, shown in home page widgets because it has type "teaching" (implicitly,
              being under the "/teaching" hierarchy. It shows all items with the cs123 category.
              Now everything else under here needs to have the cs123 type, so we can exclude it
              from the main menu.    
    
    index.md : its contents, which show a list of all items in the "cs123" category
    featured.jpg : its picture for home page  


UML/        : UML example, has category "cs123"
    index.md : the contents and what sets up that category      
    



examples/   : Java code examples; tried to make it a widget page and it
              didn't like it. Under here should be a list of examples,
              which are each in folders, each in category "example123"
              Again, cs123 type.
              Each index.md in here has a weight, determining its ordering
              in the example list
    _index.md : think this needs to have the underscore because it's
                a "branch", not a "leaf", so the examples don't get
                traversed if this isn't there.
                
file/       : just holds a filelogger example which is linked from
              the main examples; its type is set to "unindexed" so it
              doesn't get added to the "teaching" cards on the main page
              

ANYTHING ELSE is stuff which randomly gets linked from other example pages. I'm not
happy with that solution, but putting stuff under examples automatically indexes
it, and I can't see a way of avoiding that.


NOTE THAT pages can be hidden from the examples list by setting "hidden=true" - I've
modified layouts/_default/list.html to do this.
