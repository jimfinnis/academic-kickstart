## Introduction
While marking some second-year assignments last year, I found that a number
of students were still having trouble with the ideas behind classes, objects
and references. These aren't easy concepts to grasp, and some of you may still be a little
confused about exactly what classes, objects and references really *are*.

I've written these pages to help with that confusion by trying to 
show you what an object is in the computer's memory, and by adding
some little quizzes on the way.

### The PGCTHE and survey
On a personal note, the pages are part of an Action Research Plan, forming
part of my PGCTHE (Postgraduate Certificate in Teaching in Higher Education)
coursework. The aim is to identify a problem in teaching/learning,
try something that should help, and see how well it works.

As part of the "evaluation" stage of the project, I am be running a very
short survey to find out how helpful you found these pages. All the data from the
survey will be completely anonymous, and 
I'll be eternally grateful to you if
you choose to fill it in.

## The pages
Now, the pages themselves. The first few describe objects, classes and
references. Later pages (yet to be written) will show examples of real
code which link objects together in interesting ways. We'll let you know
when those pages become available.
