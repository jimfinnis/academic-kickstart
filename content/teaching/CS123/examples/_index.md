## Introduction

While marking some second-year assignments last year, I found that a number of
students were still having trouble with the ideas behind classes, objects and
references. These are important concepts, and without a good understanding of
them you will find programming difficult. I have found in the past that a
different point of view can help - a look at what classes, objects and
references **really are** inside the computer's memory. You'll see that the
basic ideas are very simple.

These web pages shouldn't take long to read, and you can come back to them
whenever you feel confused about object-oriented programming. There are
also some short quizzes to help engage your brain and to let you know if your
understanding is correct.

### The PGCTHE and survey
On a personal note, the pages are part of an Action Research Plan, forming
part of my PGCTHE (Postgraduate Certificate in Teaching in Higher Education)
coursework. The aim is to identify a problem in teaching/learning,
try something that should help, and see how well it works.

As part of the "evaluation" stage of the project, I am be running a very
short survey to find out how helpful you found these pages. All the data from the
survey will be completely anonymous, and 
I'll be eternally grateful to you if
you choose to fill it in.

## The pages
Now, the pages themselves. The **first four pages** describe objects, classes and
references. The other pages show examples of real
code which link objects together in interesting ways. We'll let you know
when those pages become available.
