## Introduction

While marking some second-year assignments last year, I found that a number of
students were still having trouble with the ideas behind classes, objects and
references. These are important concepts, and without a good understanding of
them you will find programming difficult. I have found in the past that a
different point of view can help - a look at what classes, objects and
references **really are** inside the computer's memory. You'll see that the
basic ideas are very simple.

These web pages shouldn't take long to read, and you can come back to them
whenever you feel confused about object-oriented programming. There are
also some short quizzes to help engage your brain and to let you know if your
understanding is correct.

## The pages
Now, the pages themselves. The **first four pages** describe objects, classes and
references. The other pages show examples of real
code which link objects together in interesting ways.
