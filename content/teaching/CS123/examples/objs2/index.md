## Last time
[Last time]({{< relref "../objs/" >}}) we looked at **objects**, which are
blocks of data in memory, and **classes**, which describe how those blocks
are made up.

This description applies to C's structs too, but classes and objects have
some extra features. The most important is that **classes can contain code that does stuff**.
