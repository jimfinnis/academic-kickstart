What code examples should illustrate in order

OO - what is it and what is it good for?
    it's just organising your programs by data, rather than by tasks.

    That might seem odd, but I remember when I started with C++...

    And all your tasks operate on data, so it makes sense to organise
    it by the kinds of data.
    
    A class is just a description of what a bunch of data which
    naturally goes together actually looks like.
    

References (and sharing them doesn't copy)

Nulls



Ongoing notes:
Example 1 used to use "static", but I want to reserve that for a later
example. I've kept the text in "static.md".
