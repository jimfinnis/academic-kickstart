As part of QinetiQ's team entering DSTL's [Autonomous Last Mile Resupply
competition](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accelerator-competition-autonomous-last-mile-supply/accelerator-competition-autonomous-last-mile-resupply),
our group at Aberystwyth designed and implemented an autonomous off-road
driving solution based on road detection with statistical models in
an unusual colour space.

Here's a video of our robot Tryfan following a track through the woods:
